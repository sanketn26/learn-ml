    "# Week 3 — Team Collaboration & Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course:** CrewAI for Multi-Agent Systems  \n",
    "**Week Focus:** Master inter-agent communication, delegation strategies, and consensus-building for complex collaborative workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this week, you will:\n",
    "- Implement agent delegation and role-based communication\n",
    "- Build consensus mechanisms for disagreeing agents\n",
    "- Create hierarchical team structures (CEO, leads, specialists)\n",
    "- Handle agent conflicts and decision-making\n",
    "- Implement feedback loops and iterative refinement\n",
    "- Build a real-world software development team\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Real-World Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** Building software requires multiple perspectives:\n",
    "- **Product Manager**: \"This feature must do X\"\n",
    "- **Architect**: \"We need microservices architecture\"\n",
    "- **Security Lead**: \"We must add authentication\"\n",
    "- **Dev Lead**: \"We have 2 weeks for this\"\n",
    "- **QA Lead**: \"We need 95% test coverage\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without collaboration:**\n",
    "- Team works in silos (no alignment)\n",
    "- Conflicting requirements cause delays\n",
    "- Poor quality (no peer review)\n",
    "- Missed security/performance considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**With AI Team Collaboration:**\n",
    "1. **Communication**: Agents discuss requirements and constraints\n",
    "2. **Consensus**: Reach agreement on technical approach\n",
    "3. **Specialization**: Each agent contributes expertise\n",
    "4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle disagreements systematically\n",
    "5. **Iteration**: Refine decisions based on feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Impact:**\n",
    "- ⏱️ Reduce design review meetings from 20 hrs → 2 hrs\n",
    "- ✅ Catch 40% more issues (security, architecture, performance)\n",
    "- 📈 Faster time-to-market (better decisions = fewer rewrites)\n",
    "- 💰 Save $200K/year in review/rework cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies like **Google, GitHub, Anthropic** use collaborative agent patterns internally."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 When to Delegate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delegate if:**\n",
    "- Another agent has specific expertise\n",
    "- Task requires specialized knowledge\n",
    "- Parallel execution possible\n",
    "- Subtask is well-defined\n",

    "- Agent would just repeat your work\n",
    "- Output isn't clear (ambiguous task)\n",

    "### 2.2 Effective Delegation Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. CLARIFY: \"Here's what I need and why\"\n",
    "2. SPECIFY: \"Here are detailed requirements\"\n",
    "3. DELEGATE: \"Task: {task}, Context: {context}, Success criteria: {criteria}\"\n",
    "4. RECEIVE: Get output from delegated agent\n",
    "5. REVIEW: Check if output meets criteria\n",
