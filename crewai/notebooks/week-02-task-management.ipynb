      "source": "### Understanding Task Context\n\nThe `context` parameter is crucial for building complex workflows. Here's how it works:\n\n**How Context Flows:**\n\n```python\ntask_a = Task(description=\"Research topic X\", ...)\ntask_b = Task(description=\"Write about topic X\", context=[task_a], ...)\n```\n\nWhen `task_b` executes:\n1. CrewAI automatically passes `task_a`'s output to `task_b`\n2. The agent performing `task_b` can reference this information\n3. No manual output passing required!\n\n**Multiple Dependencies:**\n\n```python\nresearch_task = Task(description=\"Research...\", ...)\ndata_task = Task(description=\"Gather data...\", ...)\nwrite_task = Task(\n    description=\"Write article using research and data\",\n    context=[research_task, data_task],  # Both outputs available!\n    ...\n)\n```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- List dependencies in `context` even if they seem obvious\n- Order matters: list them in the order they should be considered\n- Don't create circular dependencies (A depends on B depends on A)\n- Keep dependency chains reasonable (max 3-4 levels deep)"
