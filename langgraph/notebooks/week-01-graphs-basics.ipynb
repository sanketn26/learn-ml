    "# Week 1 — LangGraph Fundamentals & State Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course:** LangGraph for Complex Workflows  \n",
    "**Week Focus:** Build structured, debuggable AI workflows using directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand state machines and graphs\n",
    "- Define state schemas\n",
    "- Create nodes and edges\n",
    "- Implement branching logic\n",
    "- Debug graph execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain chains are linear: Prompt → LLM → Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Real workflows are complex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input\n",
    "  ↓\nAnalyze Issue\n",
    "  ↓\n[Bug? Feature? Question?]\n",
    " / | \\\n",
    "B  F  Q\n",
    " \\ | /\n",
    "  ↓\nRoute to Tool\n",
    "  ↓\nReturn Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph provides:\n",
    "- **State**: Shared context across nodes\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Functions in the workflow\n",
    "- **Edges**: Connections with conditional routing\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Save/resume execution\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Visualize and trace execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏢 Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a research assistant that:\n",
    "1. Takes a query\n",
    "2. Searches Wikipedia\n",
    "3. Searches academic papers (if needed)\n",
    "4. Synthesizes findings\n",
    "5. Returns report\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions at each step → perfect for graphs!"
