    "# Week 3 — Agents & Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course:** LangChain for AI Applications  \n",
    "**Week Focus:** Build agents that decide which tools to use for complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand agent reasoning loops\n",
    "- Create custom tools for agents\n",
    "- Build agents with tool selection\n",
    "- Implement ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)\n",
    "- Handle errors and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏢 Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer asks: \"What's my account balance and when is my next billing date?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent workflow:\n",
    "1. Think: \"I need two tools: get_account_balance and get_billing_date\"\n",
    "2. Act: Call both tools\n",
    "3. Observe: Get results\n",
    "4. Think: Format response\n",
    "5. Return: \"Your balance is $X. Next billing: Y\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents**: LLMs that make tool decisions\n",
    "- **Tools**: Functions agents can call (APIs, databases, calculators)\n",
    "- **ReAct**: Alternates between reasoning and acting\n",
    "- **Toolkits**: Pre-built tool collections (Google, Wikipedia, SQL)\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Gracefully recover from tool failures"
